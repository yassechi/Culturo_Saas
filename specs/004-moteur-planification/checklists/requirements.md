# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 4 — Moteur de Planification

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (frontend only — backend API complete)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (visualize, assign, suggest, verify)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Scope is intentionally frontend-only: all 6 backend rotation endpoints are already operational
- US2 (bypass button) requires role awareness: visible only to admin/formateur, hidden from stagiaire
- Stagiaire role is read-only throughout — enforced both at route level and component level
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
